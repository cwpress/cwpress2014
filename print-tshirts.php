               <h4>General Info</h4>
   				<p>These are four common shirt options we use, but don’t even scratch the surface of the products and styles we can and have print on. If you would just like to peruse some online material, check our distributors catalogs located at <a href="http://www.ourproductonline.com" target="_blank">ourproductonline.com</a> and <a href="http://www.4logowearables.com" target="_blank">4logowearables.com</a>. If you are looking for something specific or have any questions at all, please <a href="#">contact us</a>. We will be happy to help guide you through the process of choosing the right garments for your art.</p>
               
               <p>There are literally thousands of garment options, literally. If you have an idea or need something that isn't just flat out straight forward, let us know what you are trying to accomplish. We can use our network of distributors and years of problem solving experience to help you get what you are doing done.</p>
   			</div>
   			<div id="basic">
   				<h4>Basic</h4>
   				<p>Our basic shirt is the <a href="http://www.ourproductonline.com/product/0274gl/heavyweight-cotton-t-shirt.html" target="_blank">Gildan G5000</a> – 100% preshrunk cotton tee. You can substitute in similar weight from Anvil, Fruit of the Loom, Hanes, or Jerzees here but we have found over the years of doing this that gildan is the crowd favorite ten to one.</p>
               
               <p>For the price it’s a great tee, not super heavy, not super light, runs pretty true to size with a roomy cut.</p>
               
               <p>This is the good old standard tshirt. It is perfect for giveaways, those on a budget, or when you want to test the market with a new idea.</p>

   			</div>
   			<div id="ringspun">
   				<h4>Ringspun</h4>
   				<p>Ringspun cotton shirts are a step up from the basic cotton tee without having to spend the money that a higher fashion name brand would require. Our favorite is the Anvil 980. It has a nice cut and a tear away tag. There are options from gildan, hanes, and others for the same cost.</p>
               
               <p>Ringspun cotton shirts are a lighter weight than the basic cotton tee, softer feel and a more tailored cut. Theres are very similar to American Apparel or Alternative Apparel etc shirts without the higher price tag.</p> 
               
               <p>These are great shirts for anyone aiming for a fashion fit style like bands, clothing lines, and others looking to get away from a boxy cut without the top shelf price.</p>

   			</div>
            <div id="fashion">
               <h4>Fashion</h4>
               <p>The most popular fashion forward tees are the ones offered by American Apparel. There are others but AA has pretty much set the tone for these and are the one that most people are looking for when they shop for a higher cost tee.</p>
               
               <p>Extremely light weight and very soft, they typically have a worn in feel and in some cases a worn in look as well. Due to some of the processes these shirts are created with they may have unique features that make each shirt a little different.</p>
               
               <p>These are great for people who have an audience that knows exactly what they want and are willing to pay for it. These shirts typically run smaller than others so keep that in mind when planning sizes.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="ecofriendly">
               <h4>ECO Friendly</h4>
               <p>For those looking for a more ecofriendly option we have many 100% organic cotton tees, organic cotton, recycled polyester blends, and tons of options for wearables.</p>
               
               <p>We have the experience to guide you thru the process of picking the perfect shirt for your needs. Also rest assured that we incorporate earth friendly decisions into our everyday operations. Our choices in production – from emulsions,  inks, reclaiming materials / processes, and our recycling and reusing program greatly minimize the effect our company and your job will have on the environment.</p>

   <p>We also have a pretty cool looking wall of ink (PIC OF WALL) so if the color you are looking for isn’t there, we can mix it up for you. Mixing ink takes years of color theory and lots of screwing up - we have both of those under our belt so don’t sweat it, we do this every day and will nail it for you. If you want an actual pantone match, we can special order that in for you for an additional $30.</p>
