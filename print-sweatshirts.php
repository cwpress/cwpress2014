				<h4>Zip Up</h4>
				Our go-to zip up hoodie is the Anvil 71600. This medium weight hoodie has a quality zipper, white drawcords, and a 75% soft ringspun cotton / 25% polyester blend for a comfortable hoodie that holds its shape through a wash. While the white drawcords and ringspun cotton make this hoodie seem like a much more expensive product it falls in line price wise much closer to the other basic zip ups.

			<div id="pullover">
				<h4>Pullover</h4>
				There a lots of good and comparable options in pullover hoodies. We really like the Tultex pullover. It is a medium weight 80% cotton / 20% polyester blend with a tearaway tag. Another similar pullover we use a lot is the Jerzees medium weight 50/50 blend blend hoodie. You can’t go wrong with either and usually it comes down to the color you prefer or which one has more inventory at the time.
